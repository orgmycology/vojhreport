JupyterHub's impact on the world deserves to be celebrated: Over ten years of community-driven work has enabled scientists, students, systems adminstrators, and all sorts of other groups to collaboratively learn and work together. This report, based on interviews and interactions with members of the JupyterHub community, aims to celebrate these accomplishments. These conversations have also highlighted areas for improvement, from those that support better software (e.g., attracting and retaining new contributors) to those that encourage a healthier, more vibrant community (e.g., enhanced communication and collaboration). While the report is lengthy, we hope you will read it and come away feeling encouraged by JupyterHub's successes and motivated by the project's opportunities going forward. 

This report was conducted with funding from the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative by the team at [Organizational Mycology](https://orgmycology.com) and in collaboration with [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.start.page/).
