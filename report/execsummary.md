# Executive Summary

*We cannot tell the story of JupyterHub in a short, concise document that everyone will have time to read. If you read no further, you should know that this report intends to say:*

## JupyterHub is awesome:

* JupyterHub has enabled the delivery of computing and scientific research education to hundreds of thousands of students.
* JupyterHub has enabled scientific innovation, from small lab day-to-day operations to Nobel Prize-winning international collaborations.  
* JupyterHub has accomplished most of this by fostering a positive, mission-driven culture and hacking together organizational structure.

## JupyterHub can be better

* JupyterHub struggles with onboarding new contributors and delegating responsibility, owing largely to its collective humility about being at the frontier of computing education and research.
* JupyterHub’s collective leadership culture needs collective leadership structures to avoid leader burnout.

## JupyterHub has many ways forward:

* Take pride in the project and tell the stories of JupyterHub.
* Recognize that JupyterHub is a model subproject and be intentional about JupyterHub’s relationship to the broader Jupyter project.
* Develop a more unified voice and enhance communication.
* Improve onboarding/offboarding, engagement and contributor pathways.
* Have frank conversations about technical and organizational debt
* Make commitments to diversity and community health
